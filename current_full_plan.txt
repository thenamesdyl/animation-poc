Step1: First the user selects the vertices they want to animate 
Step2: raycast unto the vertices 
Step3: set the attribute in threejs 
Step4: user prompts for the animation 
Step5: sample vertices of user selection 
Step6: plug into claude 3.7 to get rough location of all the joints 
Step7: create the joints from the array of joint positions and apply to the mesh 
Step8: generate code for the animations to those bones with claude 3.7 (allow user to look at potentially) 
Step9: export glb with animation back to user
