Step 1: Project Setup and Basic Three.js Environment
Files to create:

package.json - Dependencies including Three.js, Parcel, and other necessary libraries
index.html - Basic HTML structure for the application
src/index.js - Main entry point for the application
src/scene.js - Scene setup and basic rendering
src/controls.js - Camera and user interaction controls
.gitignore - Standard files to ignore
README.md - Project documentation
I'll configure Parcel for bundling and set up a basic Three.js scene with a sample 3D model for testing. The controls will be configured with mobile support in mind, implementing dual joystick controls as mentioned in your previous work.
