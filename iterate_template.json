For each of the functions please first state which file you are putting it in. Please do not duplicate any existing logic and design in a way that is maintainable. Please place code changes in the places where it makes the most sense architecturally.         Please create a step-by-step based approach with this plan broken down into 2-4 steps. Each step can modify more than one file but should logically be together.",
